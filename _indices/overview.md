Development of long duration recordings a soundscape scale has encouraged emergence of acoustic indices. 
Acoustic indices are statistical summaries of sound characteristics, such as frequency, amplitudes, waveforms, intensity, 
to characterize changes of sound in an environment {% cite towsey2014visualization fuller2015connecting %}. Acoustic indices has adapted concepts 
from biodiversity indices, applying them and giving rise to acoustic diversity. In classical biodiversity indices, the units 
measured are species. In acoustic diversity, acoustic indices measure either intensity or loudness, complexity in sound, and 
soundscape elements {% cite Sueur_Farina_Gasc_Pieretti_Pavoine_2014 %} .
