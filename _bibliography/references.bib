@article{Krause1993,
abstract = {Native Americans have long been aware that there is a symphony of natural sounds where each creature voice performs as an integral part of an animal orchestra . They are not alone. Indigenous cultures throughout the world are keenly aware of the power and influence of natural sound in each of their musical creations. As an artist and naturalist, l have long been fascinated by the ways in which hunters from non-industrial societies determine types, numbers, and conditions of game and other creatures hundreds of meters distant through dark forest undergrowth by sound where nothing appears to the Western eye or our untrained ear to be especially distinct. As we are primarily a visual culture, no longer connected to what environments can tell us through sound, we've lost aural acuity once central to the dynamic of our lives.},

@article{Fletcher2004,
abstract = {Different animals use widely different frequencies for sound communication, and it is reasonable to assume that evolution has adapted these frequencies to give greatest conspecific communication distance for a given vocal effort. Acoustic analysis shows that the optimal communication frequency is inversely proportional to about the 0.4 power of the animal's body mass. Comparison with observational data indicates that this prediction is well supported in practice. For animals of a given class, for example mammals, the maximum communication distance varies about as the 0.6 power of the animal's mass. There is, however, a wide spread of observed results because of the different emphasis placed upon vocal effort in the evolution of different animal species.},
