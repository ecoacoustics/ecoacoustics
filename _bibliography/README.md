# Bibliography

# Style

Styles obtained manually from: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/apa.csl

You can edit which style is used by changing the `scholar.style` 
setting in the `config.yml`.

# References

We have a Mendeley library here: https://www.mendeley.com/community/ecoacoustics.info/

Again we're keeping this manually synchonized at the moment:

1. Download and install Mendeley desktop
1. Open the Mendeley shared library _Ecoaocustics.info_
1. Go to the _Documents_ tab, and select all the documents (The key shortcut
  <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> will select all).
1. Use the _File > Export_ menu option and save the result to references.bib

## Automatic export notes
