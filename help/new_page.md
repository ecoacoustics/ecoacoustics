# Create a new page

1. First determine what folder to put the file in
1. Then create a new file with a short name, in snake_case, with the ".md" extension
  - snake_case means: no upper case letters, only latin characters and underscores, no spaces
  - For example: the document for the `QUT Ecoacoustics Research group` is named `qut_ecoacoustics.md`
1. Each folder should have a README.md file, open it and copy the template into your new document
  - If it does not, please file an {% include file-issue.html %}
1. Edit the template by filling in all the sections marked with angle brackets
  (`< ... >`).
1. Add your content in Markdown
  - For help with Markdown, see [Editing in Markdown]({% link help/markdown.md %})
1. Preview your changes in the preview tab
1. When you're done, type a message in the commit message box
  - Try to include a descriptive message of the changes you have made
